## Book Poor Dad and Rich Dad

There is the saying The love of money is the root of all evil. 

But in this book i learned a new one which is The lack of money is the root of all evil.

The saying Study in school and Study hard is a load of crap. The concept of how money works is not taught at school. The school trains you to be a good employee the school doesn't train you how to be the boss.

There is a huge difference between being Poor and being Broke ,Being broke is temporary while being Poor is eternal

Today i completed Steamroller and Binary Agents

Actually in this 2 challenge i didn't managed to complete it on my own and i had to result to using guides. 

I was confused about steamroller and didn't know how to flatten an array multiple times. Turns out i needed to use recursion to flatten the array and if there is still an array within the array i need to recursively use the function again until i return an array that is flattened.

With the binary agents it was first intimidating and i got intimidated that i couldn't solve it on my own. Turns out it was pretty easy if you think about it it was just converting the binary to decimal then converting the decimal to its ASCII Code to get the answer.
