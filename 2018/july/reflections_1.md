### Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

I've completed 2 challenges today which are 

- Convert HTML Entities
- Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers

The first challenge had a medium difficulty for me because i didn't managed to pass the test case
where there are multiple entities i had to replace

The second challenge was really hard i had to get all fibonacci sequence up to the number specified
and check if the number is odd and add them to the Sum. 
It was hard because i didn't know the formula and thinking about it i had to search first for the fibonacci sequence and what i found was for recursion but what i needed was to get the value of each sequence and not return a whole number that contain the value of for example `fibonacci(5) = 5` i should get each value up to 5
