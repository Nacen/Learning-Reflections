### Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

Today i've managed to complete Drop it and Smallest Common Multiple Challenge

I've really had a hard time with Smallest Common Multiple Challenge and i had to use a guide to solve it
atleast i learned about a new algorithm which is the euclidian algorithm to get the GCD of any number which was created by euclid from greece

Drop it was pretty easy you just have to drop values from the array until you find a truthy value then return the array which was pretty easy
