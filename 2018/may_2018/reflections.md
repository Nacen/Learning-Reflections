### How to Design World:
* Domain Analysis:
1. Sketch Program Scenarios/States
2. Identify Constant Info
3. Identify Changing Info
4. Identify BigBang Options

* Building the Actual Program/Function:
1. Constants(based on domain analysis 2.)
2. Data definitions (based on domain analysis 3.)
3. Functions
   1. main first (based on domain analysis 2. and 3.)
   2. ToDo list entries
4. Work through ToDo list until done

* Work Systematically:
   * Letting you work one at a time
   * but getting many things done

* Templates: Not a beginner's approach to programming
   * Expert's way of saying
   * What do i know about the basic structure before the details?
   * a step in the process

Analysis
The analysis is a model of the program because its correctly describes the structure of the program, but has less detail, we can plan our work on the program by marking up the analysis

### Program Always Change
       There are two types of programs
       1. Programs that changes
       2. Programs that are not used
