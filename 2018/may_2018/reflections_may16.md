## Think like a programmer

Always Have a Plan

* Always have a plan instead of engaging in directionless activity and hoping for the best

* Plan always. Planning is indispensable and Plans are useless

* Plan before solving

Restate the Problem

* Restating a problem helps it might provide an insight on what the problem really is

* Restating a problem can help provide a different angle / point of view

Divide the Problem

* Always try to divide the problem into smaller parts as it's easier to solve a problem on small parts than working on it in one go

Start with what you know

* We need to start with what we know we should try to solve the problem with the tools/skill set that we currently have

* This will let us find out if our current tools/skill set is enough to solve the problem on our own

Reduce the Problem

* If we can't solve the problem currently with what we have. One thing to do is solve the problem by Elimination Process or reducing it into smaller pieces 

* We reduce the scope of the problem or we add/remove constraints so we can have a different perspective on the problem given. By reducing the problem we are making the problem simpler on each reduction until we can solve it

Analogies

* Look for analogies look for patterns on problems

* A seemingly difficult problem might be easy if you have solved other problems that are similar to it

* Analogies are one of the most powerful tool to help you solve problems but it's also hard to develop since you also need to solve other different problems to build up analogies

Experiment

* By Experiment we mean to have a plan and form a hypothesis on how we would solve the problem it's a controlled experiment in which we form a plan and see if the results would be the same as our expectations 

* By having a plan it's not just by bashing your head over again in a directionless way

Don't get Frustrated

* By being frustrated we get angry we lose our rationality

* Instead of getting frustrated on the problem take a break and don't think about the problem do other activities that will help to keep your blood flow take a step back from the computer and take a break!
