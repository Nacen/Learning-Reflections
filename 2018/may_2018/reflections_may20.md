# Reflections for May 20

* Api's now adays are really easy to use and developing programs have been abstracted in such a way that you only need to think on your project and not about the codes that will build it. Rather you need the structure it abstract you from the low level details

* Twilio is an sms api which is free and can be used for project purposes

* Today i also learned more about algebra foundations

* Reading the documentations is what developer always do
