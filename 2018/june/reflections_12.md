## Web Dev Challenge Product Landing Page

Today i haven't finished the landing page because it was harder than i thought it would be.
I needed to use flexbox of css and it taught me that i still don't have that much grasp about the topic.

i need more practice with flexbox as much as possible i also need to use media queries to complete the site to make it responsive and it was a total disaster when i don't have the media queries because the positions just go haywire.

I'll try again tomorrow for atleast 2 hours
