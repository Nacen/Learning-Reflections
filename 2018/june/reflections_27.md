### Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

I've managed to complete 4 challenges Which are 

- Sum All Numbers in a Range
- Diff Two Arrays
- Seek and Destroy
- Wherefore art thou

I've had a hard time with wherefore art thou because i had to compare the object properties,
with the source and the list of objects and see if they had the property. 
I didn't know there was a function that returns all keys/properties of an object and would
make comparison more easier and more readable.
