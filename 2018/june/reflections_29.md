### Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

I've managed to complete 4 challenges Which are 

- Spinal Tap Case
- Pig Latin
- Search and Replace
- DNA Pairing

I've had a hard time with Pig Latin because of the condition of consonant cluster for a moment i didn't know what to do if there are no vowel or until a vowel was found to replace the string until i look through the guide which enlightened me on how i should tackle the problem. 

After completing each challenge i look at the answer of other people to compare my answers to see what difference or what kind of thoughts made up their solution and it was easy to understand because they had a pseudo-code explaining their code.
