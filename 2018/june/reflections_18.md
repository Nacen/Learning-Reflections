## Web Development

Today i've practice in FreeCodeCamp with their various challenges in topics about ES6

It covered

- var and let differences
- readonly var with const
- mutate array/obj declared with const
- prevent object mutation
- use arrow function to write concise anonymous functions
- arrow func with parameters
- Rest operator to have dynamic number of parameters
- Spread Operator to unpack an array
- Destructuring with assignment
- Template literals = string interpolation
