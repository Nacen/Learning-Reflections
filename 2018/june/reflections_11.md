## Web Dev Challenge Survey Form

I have completed the FreeCodeCamp Survey Form Challenge

It was hard to build than the tribute page because i had to align things in a certain way
i needed to put the label on the left side and make sure it doesn't get moved when i put the input element on the right side.

The alignment of elements was hard to do and i have to practice on that topic.
