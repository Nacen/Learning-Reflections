# June 13 Reflections

## Web Development

I've managed to complete the FreeCodeCamp Challenge Product Landing Page. I think i got better at debugging
when i was building the product landing page as i encountered different behaviors i wasn't expecting
and i also think that i have a deeper grasp on css flexbox now, unlike before where behaviors was really unexpected and
not what i wanted it to be.

### Goals

Is to complete FCC technical docs page tomorrow
