### Object Oriented Programming and a little bit of Functional Programming

Today i've covered and learned about OOP in javascript and how oop wasn't natively built in it but we can still use the oop paradigm

A little bit of functional programming was also covered today and i felt that OOP vs FP is just a matter of situation and knowing when to use which one. They are both weapons and it really depends on the situation what weapon to use.
