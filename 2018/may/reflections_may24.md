## Responsive Web Design

* Responsiveness

Today i've practiced how to build a responsive blog while optimizing
images through css.

It also took me atleast 5 hours of frustration with debugging on what's wrong on my code
i just needed to reinstall it with legacy options

I've also completed a 4 hours work consolidating my knowledge behind optimization with images in the process
