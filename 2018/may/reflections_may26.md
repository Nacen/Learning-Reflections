# Reflections for May 26

## Dual Wielding

Yesterday i've decided that i will take backend courses for 6 hours and 1 hour for front end
or i could do 3 hours each so becoming a full stack web developer could work

* Bootstrap 4

yesterday bootstrap 4 was very hard to understand their new docs didn't explain much as bootstrap 3

* Working on a Portfolio

I've decided to work on a portfolio with the challenge given from freecodecamp

* The only thing that really fits right now

Is to try and study and use my time efficiently for it.
