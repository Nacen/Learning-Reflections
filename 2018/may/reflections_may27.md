# Reflections for May 27

## Books

* If i decided to read a book 1 hour every day i'd eventually complete a book every year which is really helpful

### Courses

* Allocating 6 hours with breaks in between is the best time for me it seems

### Building my Portfolio

* My portfolio 

My Portfolio isn't that easy to decide what to add to it since i don't have much skills yet but i should try creating a unique prototype for now.
