## Intro to Javascript

### I've learned Loops & functions

* What are Loops?

loops is used to repeat a task

* What are Functions?

functions are package/wrapper for code to reuse them

when a function declaration is assigned to a variable it's called
function expression or inline function

Functions can also be used as parameters and they are called callback functions

* Hoisting

hoisting is the process of putting function declarations at the top
One thing to consider is when using function expression is the position of the function expression since hoisting does not affect function expression.
