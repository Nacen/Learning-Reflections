## Math

Today i'm trying to complete the assignment given to me
 
## Book Poor Dad and Rich Dad

To get rich you only need to buy assets and avoid buying liabilities and that's it.

The thing is the poor doesn't know what is an asset or a liabilities.

They don't know which is which

While the middle class buys assets but also buys liabilities which balances things out 

While the rich only keeps on buying assets to get richer

## Web Dev

Today i've managed to complete arguments optional and Objects challenge

But i needed again the guide because i didn't realise that typeof an element returns not the Type itself but a string and i was comparing types with the wrong values

Objects challenge was easy it wasn't so hard though i ran into some problems because i tried to have a variable for fullname when i shouldn't be doing so. 

Because by having a seperate variable will cause a logical bug.
