## Book Poor Dad and Rich Dad

There is the saying The love of money is the root of all evil. 

But in this book i learned a new one which is The lack of money is the root of all evil.

The saying Study in school and Study hard is a load of crap. The concept of how money works is not taught at school. The school trains you to be a good employee the school doesn't train you how to be the boss.

There is a huge difference between being Poor and being Broke ,Being broke is temporary while being Poor is eternal
